0x0D. C - Preprocessor

Question #0
What are the steps of compilation?

1. preprocessor 2.compiler 3. assembler 4. linker

Question #1
The preprocessor generates assembly code

False

Question #2
The preprocessor generates object code

False

Question #3
The preprocessor links our code with libraries.

False

Question #4
This portion of code is actually using the library stdlib.

#include <stdlib.h>

False

Question #5
The preprocessor removes all comments

True

Question #6
What is the gcc option that runs only the preprocessor?

-E

Question #7
NULL is a macro

True

Question #8
What will be the last 5 lines of the output of the command gcc -E on this code?

#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    NULL;
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

int main(void)
{
 ((void *)0);
 return (0);
}

Question #9
This code will try to allocate 1024 bytes in the heap:

#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
malloc(BUFFER_SIZE)

True

Question #10
What does the macro TABLESIZE expand to?

#define BUFSIZE 1020
#define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
#undef BUFSIZE
#define BUFSIZE 37

37

Question #11
This is the correct way to define the macro SUB:

#define SUB(a, b) a - b

No, it should be written this way:

#define SUB(a, b) ((a) - (b))

Question #12
Why should we use include guards in our header files?

To avoid the problem of double inclusion when dealing with the include directive.

Question #13
The macro __FILE__ expands to the name of the current input file, in the form of a C string constant.

True

Question #14
What will be the output of this program? (on a standard 64 bits, Linux machine)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define int char

int main(void)
{
    int i;

    i = 5;
    printf ("sizeof(i) = %lu", sizeof(i));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

sizeof(i) = 1
