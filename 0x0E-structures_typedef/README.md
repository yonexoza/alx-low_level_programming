0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

Question #0
You should write documentation for all the structures you create

True
As soon as I write my structure.

Question #1
The general syntax for a struct declaration in C is:

struct tag_name {
   type member1;
   type member2;
   /* declare as many members as desired, but the entire structure size must be known to the compiler. */
};

True

Question #2
Those two codes do the same thing:

typedef struct point point;
struct point {
   int    x;
   int    y;
};
point p = {1, 2};
typedef struct point point;
struct point {
   int    x;
   int    y;
};
point p = { .y = 2, .x = 1 };

True

Question #3
Given this code:

struct point {
   int x;
   int y;
};
struct point my_point = { 3, 7 };
struct point *p = &my_point;

my_point.y = 98;
(*p).y = 98;
p->y = 98;
